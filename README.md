This is a school project for Codaisseur code academy. We are trying to make a simple netflix clone by using data from the Open Movie database. In our documentation we will refer to the Open Movie Database as OMDB.

## Project description

Title: Badflix // Batflix // Bestflix
Basically netflix but as a social media thing.

We will start by making a static feed of a few movies that people can upvote downvote etc
Then we make it possible to search and add the movie items to a feed

You can:

1. upvote and downvote movies
2. comment
3. create a list of your favorite movies.
4. select categories like
   -horror
   -action

## Technical requirements

Beginner steps.

1. Display an item from the Open movie database with the following items.

- picture
- title
- year
- description

2. Display 10 movies or less from a particular topic. I.e.

- Batman categorie. (As we progress we will try to make more interesting categories. )

3. There is a search bar with a button. When you press the search button you will aquire 10 movie items from the OMDB.
4. Display a movie from a categorie
5. there is a upvote and downvote button
6. there is a comment box
7. there is a loading button / display (shows that it's loading)
   Medium steps.

Intermidiate steps.

1. There is a search bar with a button. When you press the search button you will aquire 10 movie items from the OMDB. => There are more options. Search on categorie or pagination.
